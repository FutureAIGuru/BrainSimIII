**GitHub Pages**

Setup atm: GitHub Pages reads the website-files from the folder "/Docs/Site/" and puts the site available/usable via a webserver. 

(/By default GitHub Pages uses a branch from the project-repository with just the website-files on it. But that is less easy to navigate and inspect the website-files, and can conflict with the understanding of what branches are usually for.)
