**GitHub Pages**

Setup atm: GitHub Pages reads the website-files from the folder "/docs/" and puts the site available/usable via a webserver. 

(/By default GitHub Pages uses a branch from the project-repository with just the website-files on it. But that is less easy to navigate and inspect the website-files, and can conflict with the understanding of what branches are usually for.)

**GitHub Pages Configuration**

Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment > Source (Branch: main, Folder: "/docs/")

GitHub Pages does an automatic rebuild of the website (in seconds) if a file in "/docs/" changes.
